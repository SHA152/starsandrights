## What's Left to Build

### Study Mode Refinement
- [ ] Implement individual category pages
- [ ] Add question detail view
- [ ] Enhance filtering capabilities

### Flashcard Mode Refinement
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation
- [ ] Implement progress tracking
- [ ] Add more visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

### Practice Test Refinement
- [ ] Add more detailed results analysis
- [ ] Implement test history tracking
- [ ] Add timed test option

### English Materials Refinement

- [ ] Implement audio examples (future enhancement)
- [ ] Create printable study sheets

### UI/UX Refinement
- [x] Enhance animations and transitions
- [x] Improve mobile responsiveness with hamburger menu
- [x] Implement fixed header for better navigation
- [x] Update content boxes to take full width on desktop screens
- [x] Apply American flag color scheme (blue: #3C3B6E, red: #B22234, white: #FFFFFF)
- [x] Add custom branding (logo, favicon, app icons)
- [x] Optimize header navigation with dropdown menu
- [ ] Further optimize for very small screens (< 480px)
- [ ] Add dark mode (future enhancement)

## Known Issues

*We identified and fixed the following issues:*

1. **Practice Test Page Error**: Fixed an issue where the page was trying to access properties of undefined objects. The fix involved adding proper checks to ensure the questions array is not empty and the currentIndex is within bounds.

2. **Study Category 404 Error**: Added a CategoryStudyPage component and a route for `/study/:categoryId` to handle the study of specific categories. Previously, clicking on a category link would result in a 404 error.

3. **Flashcard Visibility Issues**: Enhanced the flashcard component with better styling for the hint text and improved the visibility of the flip animation.

4. **Flashcard Text Color**: Fixed an issue where the answer text in flashcards was white on a white background, making it difficult to read. Added specific styling for the answer text in the flashcard-back class to ensure proper contrast and readability.

5. **Mobile Responsiveness Issue**: Fixed an issue where the navigation menu was not mobile-friendly and would get cut off on smaller screens. Implemented a hamburger menu that appears on smaller screens and allows users to access all navigation links through a slide-in menu.

6. **Current Officials Section Issue**: Fixed an issue where the "Current Officials" category in the Study page was showing 0 questions. Updated the filtering logic to correctly identify and count questions about current government officials.

7. **Page Transition Error**: Fixed an issue with the page transition implementation that was causing runtime errors when navigating between pages. The solution involved restructuring the PageTransition component to properly handle React Router's location changes and using CSSTransition with a nodeRef to avoid direct DOM manipulation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- Using Create React App for quick setup
- Implementing React Router for navigation
- Using static data files for content

### Refinements
- Organized questions by category for better user experience
- Separated official questions that may change over time
- Created a responsive design that works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Implemented a mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu
- Added comprehensive information pages about the test structure and N-400 form
- Implemented an animation system to enhance the user experience
  - Added page transitions for smoother navigation between routes
  - Created scroll-triggered animations for content sections
  - Implemented staggered animations for related content groups
  - Enhanced interactive elements with hover and click animations

## Lessons Learned

- Organizing content by categories makes the large amount of information more manageable
- Separating changeable content (like officials' names) makes updates easier
- Using CSS variables for theming provides consistency across components
- Implementing responsive design with a mobile-first approach ensures compatibility across devices
- Using media queries and flexible layouts allows for a better user experience on all screen sizes
- Hamburger menus are an effective pattern for mobile navigation when there are many menu items
- Animations should be purposeful and enhance the user experience, not distract from it
- Using CSS transitions and transforms is more performant than JavaScript-based animations
- Intersection Observer API provides an efficient way to trigger animations on scroll
- Staggered animations create a more polished feel for related content groups
- When implementing page transitions, it's important to handle React Router's location changes properly

## Next Milestone Goals

1. **Study Mode Refinement**
   - Success Criteria: Individual category pages implemented, question detail view added
   - Estimated Completion: TBD

2. **Flashcard Mode Refinement**
   - Success Criteria: Keyboard navigation added, progress tracking implemented
   - Estimated Completion: TBD

3. **Practice Test Refinement**
   - Success Criteria: Detailed results analysis, test history tracking
   - Estimated Completion: TBD

## Current Focus

The current focus is on testing the application, identifying any bugs, and refining the user experience.

## Blockers

*No blockers identified at this time.*

## Future Considerations

- Potential for adding user accounts for progress tracking
- Possibility of implementing audio functionality
- Options for more interactive English practice
- Mobile optimization enhancements

These considerations are outside the scope of the MVP but may be revisited after initial implementation.
